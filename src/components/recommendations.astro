        Daniel consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of accessibility
        principles, playing a pivotal role in various initiatives. From <strong
          >research and training with Fable to component audits, accessibility
          annotations, documentation, and SME consultancy</strong
        >, <strong>Daniel's expertise was invaluable</strong>. Besides, his
        advocacy for accessibility helped shape our training program, ensuring
        that our team is well-equipped to create inclusive designs.

        Daniel is one of very few people I've worked with where <strong
          >collaboration feels effortless, effective, and fun</strong
        >. You're lucky to get one or maybe even two of those things, but he's
        the real deal. The depth and breadth of <strong
          >Daniel's knowledge is not to be underestimated</strong
        >. If you left him on an island with nothing but a sketch of a button,
        he'd probably have a fully accessible design system built for you in two
        weeks, as well as a plan for change management and training your entire
        organization.

      <p>
        Working with Daniel and getting an inside look at what makes a good
        design system was a highlight of my time at CVS. Every time we
        connected, he taught me something new or gave me something different to
        think about. I appreciated that Daniel would go above and beyond to
        solicit feedback about the design system components he was working on. <strong
          >He took a challenging role -- defining accessibility behavior for an
          enterprise design system -- and made it seem easy.</strong

        his technical understanding of how the Web functions. His skills are extremely
        valuable and rare. <strong
