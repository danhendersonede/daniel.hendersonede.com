<p>It's 2023, why am I posting an axe-con talk from 2022? I recently stumbled across the publicly available recording of my <strong>"Building Accessible Design Systems – Try, Try, Try again"</strong> talk. Since the information and learnings are all still relevant, I wanted to share it here so you can hopefully avoid the same mistakes I did.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Building a design system is a pivotal way to provide a more consistent user experience across brands, products, and platforms (Web, iOS, and Android). With many stakeholders influencing the enterprise initiative, the design system accessibility team doesn’t always win the first time around.</p>

<p>In this session, learn about some of the challenges we’ve faced when building a design system for a Fortune 500 company. Come away with ideas, suggestions, resources, and learnings to help your team develop, or refine, a consistent, accessible design system for your organization.</p>
