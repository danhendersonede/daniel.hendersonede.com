  "description": "Both design systems and accessibility teams aim to prove impact, improve efficiency, and create better products, yet they often work in silos, missing opportunities to solve mutual roadblocks. This session will explore practical strategies for fostering collaboration between these teams to address common issues such as consistency, compliance, and stakeholder buy-in. Through real-world examples and interactive discussions, attendees will learn how this partnership can streamline workflows, enhance product quality, and deliver better outcomes for their organizations."
