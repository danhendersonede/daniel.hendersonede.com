			<p>Accessibility annotations help capture design intent that cannot be conveyed through visual design alone.</p>
			<p>I led the creation of this annotations kit for CVS Health as it <a href="https://medium.com/cvs-health-tech-blog/behind-the-scenes-of-creating-a-new-web-accessibility-annotation-kit-1834815544d3">became one of their top Figma libraries</a>, with 150,000+ annotations made across 1,100+ design files.</p>

			<p>Practice your Web accessibility skills by annotating a real design from a different organization each day. Use an accessibility annotations tool of your choice (or experiment with different ones) to practice your Web annotation skills.</p>
			<p>This resource is aimed at all skill levels, with difficulty increasing over time.</p>
