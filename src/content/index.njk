				<h3>Making an impact at Pinterest</h3>
			</a>
			<p>At Pinterest, I audited 20 Gestalt Design System components, resolving 15 accessibility issues and collaborated with designers and engineers to ensure WCAG compliance. I developed an accessibility training program for 150 designers, 500 engineers, and 25 leaders, and contributed 5 accessibility guidelines for advertisers. These efforts improved the platform's accessibility for an estimated 75 million users with disabilities.</p>
