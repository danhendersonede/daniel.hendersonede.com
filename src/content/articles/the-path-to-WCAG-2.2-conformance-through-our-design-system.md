pageTitle: The path to WCAG 2.2 conformance through our design system
description: 2 years ago, myself and Meghan Morris spoke at axecon about some of the mistakes we made trying to make design systems accessible. Although I'm not speaking this year, I wanted to share with you a new blog post to celebrate our progress and encourage you to use your design system as a vessel to go above the minimum requirements to create scalable and accessible experiences.
