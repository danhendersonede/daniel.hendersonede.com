		Accessibility has always been a priority for our web component library. Daniel became our accessibility go-to in our team. He was able to support us in all accessibility-related matters. Daniel engineering background provides him with the toolkit to approach solution from both code and WCAG standards. Daniel was always very proactive, good at communication, and friendly. Working with him was a pleasure and I learned a lot from him. I hope we can work together again in the future.
