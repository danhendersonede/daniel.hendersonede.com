  <h2>Why I'm here</h2>
  <p>
    I began my career as a full-stack engineer, but as time passed I found
    myself physically shifting-left to user experience design; earning my
    <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/ux-certification/people/"
      >Nielsen Norman Group UX certification</a
    >, with a specialization in interaction design. I am now in my happy place,
    where I can apply all I have learned from each major discipline to create
    truly accessible digital products.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creating those accessible experiences is my passion, I don't know why. All I
    know is that the inclusive design process, the folks I work with, and the
    positive impact I'm able have on people's lives gives me this feeling of
    wonder and excitement that I haven't been able to consistently find
    elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p></p>

  <p>Perhaps I should get out more?</p>

  <p>
    The fact that I get to do this every day whilst providing for my wife
    &#40;Emma&#41;, dog &#40;Ashwa&#41; and guinea pigs &#40;Pookie &amp;
    Nutmeg&#41; is a privilege I'm grateful for every day.

      <h3>Accessibility is not binary</h3>
      <p>
        It's all too common to see people misunderstand accessibility as
        thinking they just need to pass the WCAG success criteria.
      </p>

      <p>
        But instead I aim above and beyond, focusing on the principles of
        accessible content &#40;perceivable, operable, understandable, and
        robust&#41;.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only way to know if that goal has been achieved is through iterative
        and inclusive user research studies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Continuously learning</h3>
      <p>
        Mistakes are inevitable, and if everything goes to plan I'll continue to
        make more so that I can improve myself and the digital experiences I
        create.
      </p>

      <p>
        The needs of the disability community are complex and evolving. I know
        that I don't fully understand it all, but I commit to always strive to
        design <strong>with</strong> disabled people in order to facilitate a
        true inclusive design process.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Gatekeepers suck</h3>
      <p>
        I cannot comprehend how I've benefited from the great people who came
        before me, or the time and knowledge people have graciously given me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My aim is to never silo what I've learned. That way other people may
        benefit the same way I have, so that we can continue to improve our
        society and create an inclusive future.
