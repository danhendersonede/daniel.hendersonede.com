		<h2>Design Systems Podcast</h2>
		<p>
      Welcome to another episode of The Design Systems Podcast! In honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we're thrilled to have Daniel Henderson-Ede, an accessibility specialist, here to discuss the need for and challenges of making inclusive design experiences for those with disabilities, and how design systems can help. Daniel shares why and how accessibility considerations should influence every decision in design systems to create better, more inclusive products. We get into the importance of theme management, and the latest updates in accessibility standards. Join us as we navigate the critical intersections of design, accessibility, and system thinking to shed light on how we can enhance user experiences on a grand scale.

      CVS Health has started to adopt accessibility annotations in the digital
      design process. Doing so has had innumerable benefits on the enterprise
      and customer experiences. Thinking about annotations in the design process
      influenced the design philosophy, and teams made design decisions that

      user experience across brands, products, and platforms (Web, iOS, and
