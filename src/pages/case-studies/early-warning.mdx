## "Protecting the UK during the COVID-19 Pandemic and the future..."

### Description

In 2019, [60% of medium/large businesses](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/791942/CSBS_2019_Infographics_-_General_Findings.pdf) reported breaches or attacks. Early Warning is a new public service designed to be used by all UK organizations to help add to their capabilities in defending against cyber-attacks. This should lead to fewer data breaches and loss of personal data, reducing the impact on the economy, where a severe breach of a FTSE 100 organization costs on average [Â£120 million](https://www.cgi.com/sites/default/files/2018-08/cybervalueconnection_full_report_final_lr.pdf).

**My Role:** Product Designer, User Researcher, User Tester, and Frontend-Engineer.

### Goal

The goal of the project was a new public service to play a critical and urgent role during the COVID-19 pandemic as critical national infrastructure (CNI) like the NHS (National Health Service) and life-saving companies such as ones developing vaccines and ventilators were [under attack by advanced persistent threats (APT)](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-cyber-crime-hack-business-dominic-raab-a9500316.html). The product owners made it of utmost importance that these organizations were receiving threat notifications from Early Warning as soon as possible.

### Success Criteria

1. Reduce the time and resources needed to process organization registrations by 50%.  
   **Achieved. Reduced time by 96%**

2. Receive a reliable System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 77.2.  
   **Achieved. SUS Score: 83.7 and NPS: 70.73%**

3. Remove the requirement for Microsoft Word to register.  
   **Achieved. Reduced barriers to entry by removing need for Microsoft Word.**

## DISCOVER

### User Interviews

To understand the current strains of the sign-up process, I interviewed the support team who interact with the user most frequently. From this, I was able to identify the asynchronous events that occurred which lead to a complicated and slow registration process.

<EWTabs
  client:load
  tabs={[
    {
      label: 'Current Journey',
      image: asIs.src,
      alt: 'The current sign-up process diagram which required 7 steps, 5 of which I identified as wasteful.',
    },
    {
      label: 'Designed Journey',
      image: toBe.src,
      alt: 'The designed sign-up process diagram which required 4 steps, 0 of which I identified as wasteful.',
    },
  ]}
/>

<div class="insights-grid">
  <div class="insight-column">
    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All manual data entry completed by the admin team was unnecessary and
        therefore a waste of tax-payer money.
      </li>
      <li>
        The use of email leads to a very asynchronous process that slowed down
        confirmations and a streamlined sign-up process.
      </li>
      <li>The number of steps in the registration could be reduced by 50%.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="insight-column">
    <h4>Future Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A website will be required to allow UK organizations to sign up online
        without the need for Microsoft Word.
      </li>
      <li>
        No public customers were contacted in this phase due to the sudden move
        to remote working when the UK first hit lockdown. Therefore it needs to
        be a priority for the future to make sure both the problem and solution
        are suitable and fit the users' needs.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

## DEFINE

### How Might We (HMW)?

Based on the popular [Google's Design Sprint kit](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/). HMW provided the environment to define what some of the most important questions and opportunities were.

This was conducted at the start of the British lockdown, due to the sudden need for remote design thinking workshops and limited licenses, I chose to host it on Google Sheets. This provided a cloud-based whiteboard solution to collate our ideas to conduct HMW, Crazy8s, and User Journey Mapping.

<Image
  src={hmw}
  alt="The How Might We results where were then affinity mapped into 7 categories: New Feeds, Analytics, Admin Section, Reducing Noise, Prioritizing Notifications, Turning feeds on/Off, Disabling feeds on specific assets."
/>

### Story Mapping

The story mapping below was crucial for prioritizing the story mapping with all the project's stakeholders. Splitting the stories into slices/main releases allowed the value to be given to the user at the earliest opportunity, therefore user feedback was gathered earlier.

<Image
  src={storyMapping}
  alt="A story mapping artifact where the backlog was mapped into 5 slices: Slice 1 (MVP), A new user can create an organization and receive reports. Slice 5's goal was to Polish Early Warning."
/>

<div class="insights-grid">
  <div class="insight-column">
    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The priority for the first release is for organizations to just submit
        their details, no need for user accounts.
      </li>
      <li>
        A key takeaway from HMW was considering how vital threat notifications
        can be prioritized against less important reports.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the affinity mapping, threat report customization is a critical
        problem group, however not a 'must' to give an initial value to the
        user.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="insight-column">
    <h4>Future Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        During the first design thinking workshop, idea generation from
        non-engineer stakeholders was limited. In the future, an example
        walk-through of HMW or Crazy8s may help initialize idea generation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Google Sheets although effective, was limiting since the size of the
        'whiteboard' was restricted. In the future using a specialist tool such
        as Mural or Miro would be beneficial.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## DEVELOP

### Prototyping

I used Figma to build high fidelity prototypes with the appropriate government branding based on an internal design system. Not only was the design system key for visual consistency, but the behavior of similar services were studied to make sure they work the same based on Jakob's Law.

Due to Figma's collaborative nature, this allowed me to involve more stakeholders with the high-fidelity designs. I went from teaching my engineering team about Figma, to now over 50 engineers in the department.

### Designing for Human Factors

To reduce barriers to entry, key UX theories and laws were used to help create a prototype with statistically proven design patterns to focus on user-centered design and create the best possible minimum viable product (MVP).

  alt="The asset details page is annotated to show which user interface design patterns were used to improve usability and reduce cognitive load. Academics, physiologists and designers were referenced to provide authority in the decisions."

  <ul>
    <li>
      The system status helps build trust with users as they feel in control and
      therefore should always be visible. (Harley, 2018).
    </li>
    <li>
      Tabs were used to split the form up as they have the advantage of being
      able to alternate between views in the same context (Nielsen, 2016).
    </li>
    <li>
      To encourage users to complete the whole process, showing the little
      number of steps required is more likely to increase the success rate
      (Babich, 2016).
    </li>
    <li>
      Highlighted and meaningful headings make the page quickly scannable
      (Nielsen, 1997).
    </li>
    <li>
      Bullet points makes the supported formats scannable (Nielsen, 2016) and
      static form help text reduces cognitive load (Whitenton, 2013).
    </li>
    <li>
      Icons help guide the user to where they need to go and should also be
      placed to the left hand-side of the label (Babich, 2016).
    </li>
    <li>
      Stating fields are "Optional" instead of a * reduces misunderstandings and
      less negative as red is associated with errors (Verner, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
      Using a universal icon such as the X to close is easily recognized and
      understood (Harley, 2014), however it should be user tested to make sure
      users have the same mental model (Vinney, 2019).
    </li>
    <li>
      Law of Proximity is used to group similar objects together each domain
      name, its label and the button to remove it. The larger gap between the
      row above shows they are independent of each other (Yablonski, 2020)
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

### Useful Error Messages

Client-side validation was key in assisting the user to spot any errors with their IP addresses when entering them into the system. The validation had to be smart though, the IPv6 has a space of 2<sup>128</sup> (340 billion billion billion billion...). therefore, telling the user to "please enter a valid IP address" was not useful, especially to less technical users who do not have a comprehensive understanding of IP addresses.

{/* Note: Original asset ip_error_messages_flow.png was commented out in original - may be missing */}

The validation was iteratively tested internally to prove initially it helped diagnose errors, although because test participants were not real users, a full usability study was conducted in the future (see below). Another consideration was also the order of validation, below shows a prototype of some of the error messages given to the user. To reduce the cognitive load, only one error was shown at once. The flow diagram below, therefore, prioritizes error messages that are related to invalid IP formats and then focused on technical boundaries such as making sure the IP was public.

  <div class="insight-column">
    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>IP validation is complicated!</li>
      <li>
        The Figma prototype was extremely useful to show stakeholders and let
        them imagine what the system will look like and behave; leading to a
        much-improved system and user experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="insight-column">
    <h4>Future Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A few stakeholders believed the progress of the service was further
        along than what had been implemented, and so in the future, I need to
        make it clear that the prototype is not connected to any APIs or
        implemented in HTML to prevent any misunderstandings.
      </li>
    </ul>

## DELIVER

### User Testing Strategy

I used the following test strategy to be confident in my design before full public release:

<div class="strategy-cards">
  <div class="card">
    <h5>Behavioral User Research</h5>
    <p>
      Each version has an improved error rate and the time taken to complete is
      reduced.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h5>Attitudinal User Research</h5>
    <p>
      A System Usability Scale (SUS) in the top 80th percentile and a Net
      Promoter Score (NPS) of at least 40.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h5>Accessibility</h5>
    <p>
      Automated testing with jest-axe and testing the accessibility on users
      with disabilities.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

### Behavioral User Research

Moderated remote usability testing was chosen to study the user's behavior, this qualitative method is a key component in the lean Toyota Production System, and will help [improve the design and a better experience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/).

The users tested were mostly Heads of Cyber Security and InfoSec inside councils and government. After each test, notes were compared with all the observers to collate issues with the interface that caused a usability slip or confusion. These were often fixed immediately to see if the changes improved the interface in the next test. Quantitative metrics were tracked throughout the study, error-rate was especially effective to test if the usability improved. The chart below shows a clear trend with each iteration that the error-rate reduced, proving that the usability has increased.

<div class="chart-container">
  <h4>Error-rate study against the version iterations</h4>
  <div class="chart-data">
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Version</th>
          <th>Error Rate</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>v1.0.2</td>
          <td>2.9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>v1.0.3</td>
          <td>1.0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>v1.0.4</td>
          <td>0.8</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>v1.0.5</td>
          <td>0.2</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

The page which caused the most errors was the assets details page, below shows the differences between v1.0.2 and v1.0.6 and the reason the changes were made to help improve the usability.

### Attitudinal User Research

To continue identifying and reducing the hurdles in registering with Early Warning, pilot users were encouraged to volunteer in an [anonymous quantitative study](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIFnQJJc_kHmrFWtcz7vPIWkk7sGRruQCG_ZQ5PO88_6WcjA/viewform).

With a sample size of 108, the overall SUS score was 83.7. SUS was used as it is a mature, non-bias, and quantitative questionnaire for validating usability, which has been [benchmarked by Lewis and Sauro's](https://uxpajournal.org/item-benchmarks-system-usability-scale-sus/) to compare the score against. Early Warning's score shows that the service is in the **top 90-95 percentile for usability**.

  <div class="insight-column">
    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Early Warning is an extremely usable service that should have few
        barriers to registration, a key goal of the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        SUS is helpful at benchmarking against other services within the same
        ecosystem to see how users compare them.
      </li>
      <li>
        [Nielsen's
        research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/)
        on only 5 users required to locate 85% of usability issues was
        repeatable.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="insight-column">
    <h4>Future Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add an open-ended question in the usability survey earlier on, as the
        first 50 organizations were unable to share valuable qualitative
        feedback immediately after using our service.
      </li>
      <li>
        I expect the NPS to decrease over time as organizations who are new and
        do not have any previous loyalty to the company; the current results are
        likely skewed by these biases.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## FUTURE WORK & EVALUATION

The next stage of the project is to allow users to access their organization's assets and contacts so they can update their details quickly and easily. With more organizations conducting cloud transformations, it is even easier to acquire new IP addresses and domain names. If this process is not also effortless, in a very short period organizations details could be out of date, and therefore will not be receiving the latest threat reports on their assets.

One of the main success criteria was to reduce the time and resources needed to process organization registrations by 50%. The new process nearly doubled this, **new registrations can now be processed 96% faster**.

{/* Note: Original comments.gif was commented out */}

That result would have not been as major if the System Usability Scale (SUS) was not so high either. A score of 77.2 was the target, which would have [benchmarked it at B+](https://uxpajournal.org/item-benchmarks-system-usability-scale-sus/), instead, it reached grade A. This amazing score is also backed up by some of the comments said by users during user testing and feedback.

Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Early Warning has had 1000s of registrations from critical national infrastructure and some of the largest companies in the UK. Although there was no target set for the number of registrations, this far exceeded expectations and the NPS score of 70.73% shows that other companies and organizations are likely to register soon as well.
