          I've spent the last 8+ years making complex things simpler at
          companies like Pinterest, CVS Health, and the UK Government. As a
          Design Engineer, I love building systems that make are accessible for
          everyone.

    <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
    <h3>Pinterest â€“ Foundations for Scalable Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      Built the accessibility infrastructure inside one of the world's most-used
      design systems. Led cross-functional work on annotations, component
      audits, and team education.
    </p>
    <h3>Project 2 â€“ e.g. "Design + Code for Healthcare App"</h3>
    <p>
      Redesigned key workflows and delivered production-ready components that
      improved both usability and accessibility for patients navigating care.
    </p>
    <h3>Project 3 â€“ e.g. "Tooling for Accessible Design Feedback"</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a lightweight review system that helped product teams catch
      issues early and ship with more confidenceâ€”without needing a full audit.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a designer with an engineering brain and an accessibility lens. I've
      worked across the stackâ€”from writing alt text guidance to shipping
      production componentsâ€”and I specialize in bringing clarity to complex
      systems. My favorite projects live at the intersection of design, dev, and
      inclusion.
