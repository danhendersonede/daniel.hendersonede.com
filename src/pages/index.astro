        <p>
          Whether I'm shaping accessibility strategy, designing at scale, or
          engineering better front-e nd experiences, my goal is the same: solve
          the right problems, early, and make great design easier for everyone
          else.

    <h2>Featured Projects</h2>
    <h3>Pinterest – Foundations for Scalable Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      Built the accessibility infrastructure inside one of the world's most-used
      design systems. Led cross-functional work on annotations, component
      audits, and team education.
    </p>
    <h3>Project 2 – e.g. "Design + Code for Healthcare App"</h3>
    <p>
      Redesigned key workflows and delivered production-ready components that
      improved both usability and accessibility for patients navigating care.
    </p>
    <h3>Project 3 – e.g. "Tooling for Accessible Design Feedback"</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a lightweight review system that helped product teams catch
      issues early and ship with more confidence—without needing a full audit.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a designer with an engineering brain and an accessibility lens. I've
      worked across the stack—from writing alt text guidance to shipping
      production components—and I specialize in bringing clarity to complex
      systems. My favorite projects live at the intersection of design, dev, and
      inclusion.
