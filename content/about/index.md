# About Me

## Why I'm here

I love creating accessible digital experiences. There I said it. It's my passion,
I don't know why, but the process, people, and impact I can have on the world gives me this feeling
of wonder and excitement that I haven't been able to consistently replicate
anywhere else.

Maybe I should get out more?

But the fact I get to do this everyday to provide
for my wife, dog (Ashwa) and guinea pigs (Pookie & Nutmeg) is a privilege
that I don't think I will truly ever appreciate.

## My core values

### Always evaluate and take on feedback, even if it is critical.

As the kid with the red hair, I was picked on a lot growing up, but this
quickly helped me learn how to grow a thick skin. The callouses that formed
gave me the ability to ask tough questions on what I have created, or
my performance; even if I knew it could be critical. However, this is
important to me as one of my methods of reflection, so I can improve
and produce better products.

### Continuous learning

Getting feedback is no good without applying those learnings. Mistakes are
inevitable, ask my wife, I've made lots and if everything goes to plan, I'll
continue to do so. But I see that as a good thing, as long as I'm moving forwards.

The disability community is complex and always evolving. I know that I don't fully understand
all the needs that exist, but I commit to always striving to design **with** disabled folks to
truly represent the people that I advocate for.

### Gatekeepers suck

I can't comprehend how I benefited from the great people who came before I, and
the time + knowledge people have graciously given me. My aim is to never silo my
knowledge that way the people right now, and in the future may benefit from what
I have learned over the years to improve our society and create an inclusive future.

If you feel I am ever not achieving these values, please reach out to me so I can make things right.
